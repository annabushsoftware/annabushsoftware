## 👋 Hello there! I’m Anna Bush, and I am a freelance software engineer.

A quick overview of what I do:

⭐ Expert in web development, full stack engineering, and connected devices

⭐ 5 years of professional experience working with teams ranging from small start-ups to large corporations

⭐ Exceptional design implementation - I code web designs into reality with a rare eye for detail 

⭐ User experience focused programming

⭐ Quality code - follows industry best practices, readable and maintainable, test driven development, thorough quality assurance testing

## 👀 I’m interested in collaborating with teams / individuals who:
- are looking for an expert in full-stack software engineering
- are looking for an expert in front-end web development
- have website designs that are ready to be transformed into live code
- no designs yet, but perhaps simply have a designer that would like an engineer's perspective

Not sure if that's you? Reach out and I'll be happy to chat to discuss if I can fit your needs!
