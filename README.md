- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! Iâ€™m Anna Bush, and I provide freelance services as an expert in web development, full stack engineering, and connected devices. I bring 5 years of professional experience working with teams ranging from small start-ups to large corporations. My specialty is delivering exceptional design implementations - I code web designs into reality with a rare eye for detail and user experience focused programming. I always ship quality code, which follows industry best practices, is readable and maintainable, includes test driven development as requested, and has been thoroughly tested for quality assurance.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in collaborating with teams that are looking for an expert in full-stack or front-end web development, who have website designs that are ready to be transformed into live code, or perhaps simply a designer that would like an engineer's perspective. Not sure if that's you? Reach out and I'll be happy to chat and see if I can be the right fit for your needs and your team!
